Student Progression Outcome System 

This Python program predicts student progression outcomes at the end of each academic year based on University credit regulations. 

The program takes inputs for:
- Credits at **Pass**
- Credits at **Defer**
- Credits at **Fail**

It then determines the outcome:
- **Progress**
- **Progress (module trailer)**
- **Do not progress â€“ module retriever**
- **Exclude**

The outcomes are displayed and summarised in both horizontal and vertical histograms.

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the script using:
```bash
python Python_Coursework_w1823431.py
